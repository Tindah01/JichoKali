## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automated CI/CD Workflows

#### Performance Budget Check (`.github/workflows/performance-budget.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Every push and PR to main/develop
- **Checks**: Bundle sizes, Core Web Vitals, Lighthouse scores
- **Actions**: Fails build if budgets exceeded
- **Reports**: Detailed performance analysis posted to PRs

#### Performance Regression Detection (`.github/workflows/performance-regression.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Pull requests only
- **Compares**: PR branch vs. base branch metrics
- **Threshold**: 5% bundle size increase detection
- **Actions**: Blocks merge if significant regression detected

### 2. Local Development Tools

#### Performance Budget Checker
```bash
npm run performance:budget    # Quick budget validation
npm run performance:full      # Build + budget check
npm run performance:analyze   # Visual bundle analysis
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks
- Automatic performance validation before commits
- Prevents performance regressions from being committed
- Provides optimization guidance

### 3. Comprehensive Configuration

#### Central Configuration (`performance-budget.config.cjs`)
- Single source of truth for all performance thresholds
- Configurable budgets for different asset types
- Core Web Vitals and Lighthouse score requirements

#### Tool-Specific Configurations
- **Lighthouse CI**: `lighthouserc.js` with detailed audit settings
- **Bundlesize**: Package.json integration for simple size checks
- **Vite Build**: Advanced optimization configuration

## 🔄 Development Workflow Integration

### 1. Local Development
```bash
# Before making changes
npm run performance:full  # Establish baseline

# During development  
npm run dev              # Normal development

# Before committing
# (Automatic via pre-commit hook)
npm run performance:full  # Validates budgets
```

### 2. Pull Request Process
1. **Create PR** → Triggers performance regression analysis
2. **Automated Analysis** → Compares with base branch
3. **Report Generation** → Detailed performance report posted
4. **Review Process** → Team reviews performance impact
5. **Merge Decision** → Based on performance and functionality

### 3. Continuous Monitoring
- **Every Commit**: Performance budget validation
- **Every PR**: Regression detection and comparison
- **Production Builds**: Comprehensive performance audits
